# Matrix-orientation-and-colour-recognition.
An algorithm that orients a picture correctly (black circle and bars in the top left hand side), transforms it to the original shape (square) and returns a matrix of the colours present in the colour square.  

Example image is in the files, the image requires distortion, rotation and the colours to be extracted. 

The algorithim uses the points and bars to detect oritentation, K means clustering to recognise colours and the location of the 4 circles to adjust distortion.
